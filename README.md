## Insight whiteboarding and data challenges

My Insight repo with the contents listed below:  

1. A notebook that contains the solutions to most the CS whiteboarding questions asked during Insight Toronto Session 19C, as well as, some other miscellaneous questions from Stats and Machine Learning. [Interview-Prep-CS-Stats-ML](Interview-Prep-CS-Stats-ML.ipynb)

2. The notebooks created during the weekly data challenges used to prepare a presentation. Each week a specific data challenge was assigned and to be complete in 4 hours. The associated data for each data challenge has also been included so the notebooks run from top to bottom.
