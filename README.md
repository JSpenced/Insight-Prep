## Insight Whiteboarding and Data Challenges

My Insight repo containing a notebook with whiteboarding solutions and the weekly data challenges in each folder:  

1. A notebook that contains the solutions to most the CS whiteboarding questions asked during Insight Toronto Session 19C, as well as, some other miscellaneous questions from Stats and Machine Learning.

2. The notebooks created during the weekly data challenges used to prepare a presentation. Each week a specific data challenge was assigned and to be complete in 4 hours. The associated data for each data challenge has also been included so the notebooks run from top to bottom.
